title: An introduction to the Hare programming language
summary: |
  This tutorial will introduce you to the Hare programming language. It
  should take about an hour to complete. If you are already familiar with
  programming in other languages, it might take even less time â€” feel free to
  jump around as you see fit.

  After you complete this tutorial, you should move on to the
  [standard library introduction](/tutorials/stdlib).
# TODO:
# - Drop vague allusions to simple/complex expression types; introduce type
#   hinting instead
# - Variadic functions
# - Match on nullable pointer types
---

## Before you start

Make sure to follow the [installation instructions](/installation) for your
platform. You need to be using one of the [supported platforms](/platforms).

## "Hello, world!"

To test that your installation went smoothly, and to introduce you to the build
tools, we'll compile and run the traditional "Hello, world!" program. It is
recommended to set aside a dedicated directory for each Hare program you want to
run. Create one of those now: `mkdir example`; then `cd example`. With your
editor of choice, open a file named `main.ha` and fill it in with the following
contents:

```hare
use io;

export fn main() void = {
	io::println("Hello, world!");
};
```

You can run this program with the following command:

```
$ hare run main.ha
Hello, world!
```

Or, you can compile it to an executable like so:

```
$ hare build -o example main.ha
$ ./example
Hello, world!
```

We'll go into more depth on the build system later on.

## Basic usage

Let's go over some basic features of Hare.

### Variable bindings

Variable give names to values, and are bound using the `let` and `const`
keywords, and assigned to with the `=` keyword. Variables defined with `let` are
*mutable*, and can be changed later. Variables defined with `const` are
*immutable*, and may not be modified after their initialization. You can define
and use variables like so:

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

export fn main() void = {
	const x = 10;
	let y = 20, z = 30;
	// Print our variables:
	io::println(strconv::itos(x + y + z));
	y = 30;
	io::println(strconv::itos(x + y + z));
};
```

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br /> <code>// ...</code> is used for
comments &mdash; these are ignored by the compiler, but useful to anyone reading
your code.</p>

In this case, the type of the variable is *inferred* from its *initializer*,
which is the value to which it is initially set. Initializers are mandatory when
declaring variables. There are very few cases where type inference is permitted
in Hare. You may choose to (or in some cases, are required to) declare the type
explicitly:

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

export fn main() void = {
	const x: int = 10;
	let y: int = 20, z = 30;
	io::println(strconv::itos(x + y + z));
	y = 30;
	io::println(strconv::itos(x + y + z));
};
```

This program is functionally equivalent to the previous program. In general,
type inference is *not* used throughout Hare, but simple variable bindings are
an exception. We'll explain the other cases later, but if in doubt, add the
type.

### Arithmetic expressions

We glossed over the use of the addition operator (`+`) in the previous example,
so let's quickly address the arithmetic operations available in Hare. The
following *binary arithmetic* operations are supported:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Operator</th>
			<th>Effect</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td><code>+</code></td><td>Addition</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>-</code></td><td>Subtraction</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>Multiplication</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>/</code></td><td>Division</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>%</code></td><td>Modulus</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>|</code></td><td>Binary OR</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&</code></td><td>Binary AND</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>^</code></td><td>Binary XOR</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&lt;&lt;</code></td><td>Left shift</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&gt;&gt;</code></td><td>Right shift</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Some operators are *logical* operators, which produce a *boolean* result &mdash;
either true or false:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Operator</th>
			<th>Effect</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td><code>==</code></td><td>Logical equality</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>!=</code></td><td>Logical inequality</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&lt;</code></td><td>Less than</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&lt;=</code></td><td>Less than or equal to</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&gt;</code></td><td>Greater than</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&gt;=</code></td><td>Greater than or equal to</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>||</code></td><td>Logical OR</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&&</code></td><td>Logical AND</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>^^</code></td><td>Logical XOR</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The precedence of the operators is similar to the [C precedence
rules][precedence] that are used in many other programming languages. The main
difference is that we've given higher precedence to binary arithmetic than
logical equality. This change should never trip you up &mdash; it just makes
some expressions easier to write.

[precedence]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B#Operator_precedence

<details>
<summary>Click here to read an explanation anyway</summary>
<p>
The main difference from C precedence is that we've given a higher precedence to
binary arithmetic than to logical arithmetic. This fixes a long-standing issue
with C precedence when doing math with bitfields.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider <code>x & BIT_FOO != 0</code>. In C, this is interpreted
as <code>x & (BIT_FOO != 0)</code>, but in Hare, we view it as <code>(x &
BIT_FOO) != 0</code>. The latter is generally what you want.
</p>
<p>
If you're worried about mixing up precedence when writing Hare expressions,
don't. Unlike C, arithmetic operations like `&` and `<` only work on numeric
operands, and not booleans; and the logical operations like `&&` and `==` only
work on booleans, and not numeric operands. If you make a mistake, you will
always get a compiler error &mdash; but not the wrong behavior.
</p>
</details>

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
The parenthesis operators <code>()</code> can be used to address precedence
issues in Hare expressions. For example, if you did want to multiply
<code>x</code> by <code>y&nbsp;+&nbsp;z</code>, you could write
<code>x&nbsp;*&nbsp;(y&nbsp;+&nbsp;z)</code>.  Generally, Hare programmers are
encouraged to learn the precedence of the operators and avoid using unnecessary
parenthesis in their expressions.
</p>

These "binary" operators compute a result from two *operands*. We also support a
number of *unary* arithmetic operations:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Operator</th>
			<th>Effect</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td><code>-</code></td><td>Negation</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>+</code></td><td>(no effect)</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>~</code></td><td>Binary NOT</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>!</code></td><td>Logical NOT</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>Pointer dereference</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>&</code></td><td>Addressing operator</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>^</code></td><td>Transfer operator</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Binary operators use *infix* notation, e.g. `2 + 2`. Unary operators use
*prefix* notation, e.g. `-10`. The last three unary operators listed here are
used with pointer types, which are [discussed later](#memory-management).

### Conditional expressions: if

We can utilize logical operators to implement conditional logic with the `if`
expression. `if` expressions allow your program to take a different *branch* for
each case, true or false. Consider the following example:

```hare
use io;
use os;

export fn main() void = {
	if (len(os::args) == 2) {
		io::println(os::args[1]);
	} else {
		io::println("No argument provided");
	};
};
```

`os::args` is the list of arguments passed into your program. If there are
exactly two of these, the first branch of the if expression is taken and the
argument is printed. Otherwise, the second branch is taken, and "No argument
provided" is printed.

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />Take note of the semicolon
(<code>;</code>) at the end of the if expression &mdash; semicolons are required
after <strong>all</strong> expressions. There's also a semicolon after the
function!</p>

You can try this program like so:

```
$ hare run main.ha
No argument provided
$ hare run main.ha hello
hello
```

The first value in `os::args` is the name of the program. Try this program
instead:

```hare
use io;
use os;

export fn main() void = {
	io::println(os::args[0]);
};
```

```
$ hare run main.ha
main.ha
$ hare build -o example main.ha
$ ./example
./example
```

#### A note on logical operators

`||` and `&&` are used to compare two boolean values, respectively they are the
"or" and "and" operators. The former is <strong>true</strong> if *either*
expression is true and <strong>false</strong>; the latter is true if *both*
expressions are true. The `^^` operator is logical XOR, which gives true if the
values are different, and false if they are the same (`!=` does the same thing).

Logical OR and logical AND are special: they can *short-circuit*. If the result
can be inferred from the first expression, the second expression is *not*
evaluated. In the case of `||`, if the first expression is true, we can infer
that the result will be true regardless of the second expression. In the case of
`&&`, if the first expression is false, we can infer that the result will be
false. This can be important if the second expression has side effects, for
example:

```hare
if (2 == 4 && crash_the_program()) {
	// ...
} else if (2 == 2 || crash_the_program()) {
	// ...
};
```

In this code, `crash_the_program()` will never be evaluated.

#### "if" as an expression

Hare is an *expression-based* programming language. The result of an if
expression has a type and a value, and you can use it as such. For example,
consider the following:

```hare
use io;
use os;

export fn main() void = {
	const message = if (len(os::args) == 1) {
		"Program was run without args";
	} else {
		"Program was run with args";
	};
	io::println(message);
};
```

The result of an if expression is taken from the last value in each branch, in
this case a string. If these values are all the same, the result type is that
type. Otherwise, the result type is a *tagged union* of the possible types; this
is explained more later. An `if` expression with just one branch &mdash; that
is, no "else" &mdash; always has the `void` type.

One other detail: any branches which cause the function to *terminate* are not
considered for the result type:

```hare
const message = if (len(os::args) == 1) {
	io::errorln("Usage: myprog <argument>");
	return;
} else os::args[1];
```

Speaking of *branches*, you can get more than two with `else if`:

```hare
use io;
use os;

export fn main() void = {
	io::println(if (len(os::args) == 1) {
		"Program was run without args";
	} else if (len(os:args) == 2) {
		"Program was run with one argument";
	} else {
		"Program was run with several args";
	});
};
```

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
Hare does not have a <em>ternary</em> operator like C's
<code>cond : x ?  y</code>, preferring the use of expressions like
<code>if (cond) x else y</code>. The braces (<code>{}</code>) may be omitted for
simple cases such as this.
</p>

### For loops

Hare supports just one kind of loop: for loops. A "for" loop has three parts:
the binding, the predicate, and the afterthought. At the start of the loop, the
binding is set; at the start of each iteration, the predicate is evaluated to
determine if the loop shall continue; and at the end of each iteration, the
afterthought is run.

```hare
for (let x = 0; x < 10; x += 1) {
	io::println(strconv::itos(x));
};
```

This program will print the numbers zero through nine.

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
See the <code>x += 1</code> operator there? <code>+=</code> is short for "add,
then assign". This expression adds 1 to x and assigns the result to x; it is
shorthand for <code>x = x + 1</code>.
</p>

There are two additional forms of for loops that you may wish to use at times.
First, you may omit the binding:

```hare
let x = 0;
for (x < 10; x += 1) {
	io::println(strconv::itos(x));
};
```

This is useful if you want to access the final value of a loop variable after
the loop ends. You may also omit the afterthought:

```hare
for (true) {
	io::println("10 PRINT \"HELLO\"");
	io::println("GOTO 10");
};
```

This is an infinite loop.

#### Loop control operators

The `break` and `continue` keywords are provided to influence the loop flow
outside of the predicate. The `break` keyword will terminate the loop
immediately, and the `continue` keyword will immediately begin the next
iteration, skipping the remainder of the code in that loop. The following for
loop will print the numbers zero through nine, but skip five:

```hare
for (let x = 0; x < 10; x += 1) {
	if (x == 5) {
		continue;
	};
	io::println(strconv::itos(x));
};
```

Replace `continue` with `break` and this loop will terminate at five, printing
only the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Functions

You've been using the `fn` keyword to declare the "main" function in each of
the examples shown so far. You can use this keyword again to create your own
functions, like so:

```hare
use io;

fn say_hello() void = {
	io::println("Hello, world!");
};

export fn main() void = {
	say_hello();
};
```

The components of a function declaration are the export status (optional), the
`fn` keyword, the function name (written in lowercase_snake_case), the parameter
list (optional), and the result type (`void` in these examples). The export
status will be discussed more when we cover modules; the short explanation is
that it determines whether or not the function is visible from outside this
module.

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
Hare does not require <em>forward declarations</em> like C does &mdash; you can
declare and use functions in any order. However, forward declarations are still
possible for declaring functions which are externally defined, such as in a
third-party C library.
</p>

The two functions in this example accept no parameters, but we could define one
that does:

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

fn add_ints(a: int, b: int) int = a + b;

export fn main() void = {
	let x = add_ints(2, 4);
	io::println(strconv::itos(x)); // 6
};
```

Note that the braces are optional. Some expressions, known as *simple*
expressions, are permitted to be written in a "bare" form like this. The same
rule of thumb we used for variable type inference applies here: if an expression
has multiple *branches*, it is considered *complex*; otherwise it is usually
*simple* and can be used in this manner. Regardless, we may add braces if we
wish:

```hare
fn add_ints(a: int, b: int) int = {
	return a + b;
};
```

However, if we do, we must use the `return` keyword to explicitly "return" the
value to the caller. This can also be used at any time to "return" early:

```hare
fn add_ints(a: int, b: int) int = {
	if (a == 3 || b == 3) {
		// 3 is evil
		return -1;
	};
	return a + b;
};
```

### Constants

It's often convenient to assign a name to a constant value, such as Pi. The
`def` keyword is used for this purpose (and also for user-defined types &mdash;
to be explained later).

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

def THE_ANSWER: int = 42;

export fn main() void = {
	io::println(strconv::itos(THE_ANSWER));
};
```

Constants are written with UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE.

### Globals

The use of globally mutable variables ("globals") is discouraged. However, they
are necessary in some cases, and support is provided. You can use the `let`
operator outside of the context of a function to create a global:

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

let x: int = 1337;

export fn main() void = {
	io::println(strconv::itos(x));
};
```

The type specifier (`: int`) and initializer (`= 1337`) are mandatory for
globals.

## Types

Hare's type system is relatively small and straightforward.

### Primitive types

The following primitive types are available:

- `int`, `uint`: native-precision signed and unsigned integer, respectively
- `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`: explicit-precision signed integers
- `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`: explicit-precision unsigned integers
- `f32`, `f64`: floating point numbers, 32- and 64-bit respectively
- `bool`: boolean type (either true or false)
- `rune`: a single Unicode character (like 'q' or 'å’Œ')

"Native-precision" types vary in their specific precision according to the
target architecture; usually they are 32 or 64 bits. Explicit-precision types
use the precision in bits specified by the numeric suffix in the type name, i.e.
i8 is an 8-bit signed integer and u32 is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

Numeric constants are supported in Hare with an explicit precision. The constant
`1234` is of type `int`, and `1234u` is of type `uint`. You can use an explicit
precision as well: `1234u16` is a `u16`, and `12f32` is `12.0` represented as an
`f32`.

Alternate numeric constant formats include hexadecmial using `0x` notation (e.g.
`0xDEADBEEF`), binary via the `0b` notation (e.g. `0b101010`), and octal with a
leading zero (e.g. `0644`).

TODO: Add scientific form

Additionally, the following primitive types have special semantics:

**void** is a type of size zero. It is used only in special cases, and a
variable of this type may not be declared.

**size** is an unsigned integer which can specify a size at least as large as
the native address space. It is the result type of the `size` operator and is
used for array and slice indicies.

**uintptr** is an unsigned integer capable of representing a pointer type
numerically. This is used for pointer arithmetic, though its use is discouraged.

**char** is similar to u8 and is available for compatibility with C. It is not
used directly.

### Strings

The `str` type represents an immutable string (immutable meaning it cannot be
changed, or *mutated*) with a fixed length. Strings are stored prefixed with
their length (as `size`), followed by the string contents as UTF-8, then a NUL
terminator (which is not included in the length).

String manipulation in Hare deserves special treatment, we'll discuss it in
depth in the [standard library introduction](/tutorials/stdlib) later on.

### Arrays

An array stores many items of a type, and has a fixed length. The syntax is
<code>[<em>length</em>]<em>type</em></code>, e.g. `[5]int`. A specific member of
an array can be accessed by *indexing* the array, like so:

```hare
let x: [5]int = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
x[3]; // 4
x[3] = 10;
```

You can also use an underscore instead of the number of items as a short-hand:

```hare
let x: [_]int = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

This is an array of fixed length, 5 items long, but the length is inferred from
the value.

Note that Hare arrays are *zero-indexed*, meaning the first item in the array is
at index zero. Also take note of the array initialization syntax shown here.

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
Array accesses like this are <em>bounds-checked</em> at runtime. Attempting to
access an item beyond the end of the array, or before the beginning of the
array, will abort the program.
</p>

The length of an array may be obtained with the `len` operator. In this case,
`len(x)` would return 5.

#### Array initializer shorthand

Hare requires that you provide an initializer for all variables, and this may
often be cumbersome when working with large arrays. The following code would
become tiresome quickly:

```hare
let x: [4096]int = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, // and so on
```

Hare offers a syntax for filling out the remainder of an array for you via the
`...` operator:

```hare
let x: [4096]int = [0...];
```

In this example, Hare will populate the remainder of the array with zeros.
Note that it needn't be zeros, nor the first item that is extended; the
following is also valid:

```hare
let x: [4096]int = [1, 2, 3...];
```

In this case, the first item is one, the second is two, and all remaining items
are three. For obvious reasons, the use of an inferred array length (`[_]int`)
is not allowed here.

#### Unbounded arrays

It may occasionally be useful to use an array of undefined length, which is not
bounds-checked at runtime. You can do this by using `*` in place of the length
in the type, e.g. `[*]int`. Use this feature with care.

### Slices

A slice is an indirect view of an array. It is used for two purposes: as a
subset of another array or slice, or as an array which can grow at runtime. A
slice has three properties: its length, its *capacity*, and an indirect
reference to the underlying storage. Like arrays, the length of a slice may be
obtained with the `len` operator.

As with strings, slices merit a more in-depth discussion in the [standard
library introduction](/tutorials/stdlib). We'll keep it brief for this
tutorial and stick to the features provided by the language.

#### Slicing expressions

You can use the `..` indexing operator to obtain a subset of another slice, also
known as a *sub-slice*. The subslice operator may also be used on an array, but
such slices are immutable.

For illustrative purposes, consider the following array:

```hare
let x: [_]int = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

To create a subslice, use the syntax
<code>x[<em>start</em>..<em>end</em>]</code>, where start is the index of the
first element, and end is the index of the last element. "Start" is *inclusive*,
meaning that it includes the item at that index, and "end" is *exclusive*,
meaning that it includes items *up to*, but not including, the "end" index.

The start or end index may be omitted entirely. If omitted, zero is used for
start, and `len(array)` is used for end. `x[..]` creates a sub-slice of the
entire slice.

```hare
x[1..4]; // 2, 3, 4
x[2..4]; // 3, 4
x[..2];  // 1, 2
x[2..];  // 3, 4, 5
x[..];   // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

### Structs & unions

A "struct" type is used to create an aggregate type encapsulating several other
types. They are declared with the following syntax:

<pre><code>struct {
	<em>field</em>: <em>type</em>,
	<em>field</em>: <em>type</em>,
	// ...
}</code></pre>

A simple example could be used to store coordinates in a 2D plane:

```hare
let coords: struct {
	x: int,
	y: int,
} = // ... 
```

A *struct initializer* is very similar, but also provides initializers for the
values:

```hare
let coords = struct {
	x: int = 10,
	y: int = 20,
};
```

Thus, a fully qualified declaration & initialization of this variable would be:

```hare
let coords: struct {
	x: int,
	y: int,
} = struct {
	x: int = 10,
	y: int = 20,
};
```

Evidently, this is somewhat redundant, so type inference is preferred for this
case. To access a struct field, the `.` operator is used.

```hare
coords.x; // 10
coords.x = 42;
```

#### Struct embedding

Structs may also "embed" another struct type directly into itself, by specifying
the type without naming a field. For example:

```hare
let coords = struct {
	x: int = 10,
	y: int = 20,
	struct {
		z: int = 30
	},
};
```

You may use `coords.z` as if you would use any other field. This example is
somewhat contrived &mdash; this becomes more useful when combined with
user-defined types, which [we will cover](#type-aliases--user-defined-types)
momentarily.

#### Partial initialization

Large named structs (see [type aliases](#type-aliases--user-defined-types))
where it's tedious and unnecessary to initialize every member can initialize all
members to their default values by adding `...` to the struct initializer:

```hare
let coords = coordinates { ... };
let coords = coordinates { x = 10, ... };
```

Not all types have a default value &mdash; the compiler will tell you if there's
anything you're required to fill out yourself.

#### Union types

Union types, or "untagged" unions, use the same syntax as structs with the
"union" keyword instead of the struct keyword. In a struct, each field is laid
out in memory one after another, creating a type whose size is the sum of its
members (well, not exactly, but this approximation will be sufficient for now).

A union differs in that it creates a type whose size is the *maximum* size among
its field types, rather than the *sum* of its field types, and all of the fields
are stored at the same location in memory.

If you don't know why this is useful, you probably don't need it.

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
The ABI representation of structs and unions in Hare is compatible with C.
<p>

### Tagged unions

A tagged union is an aggregate type whose value is exactly one of its subtypes.
The syntax for a tagged union type is <code>(<em>type</em> | <em>type</em> |
...)</code>, e.g. `(i32 | f32)`. A type of `(i32 | f32)` can store either an
i32 or an f32. The representation of a tagged union in memory is a `uint` which
indicates which of the types is selected (called the "tag"), followed by the
value itself, with sufficient space to store any of the possible types.

#### Matching

The most common way to use a tagged union is with a match expressions. Given a
tagged union value, you can provide several options to execute for each of the
possible types.

```hare
let x: (int | str) = 1234;
match (val) {
	int => io::printf("int\n"),
	s: str => io::printf("str: {}\n", s),
};
```

In each match case, you may *bind* the value to a new variable of the matched
type. In this example, the `str` case is bound to `s` to be passed to
`io::printf`.

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
Match expressions are required to be <em>exhaustive</em>, meaning that all
possible cases are handled. The <code>*</code> case can be used to match any
case which is not explicitly handled: <code>* => ...</code>
</p>

TODO: Explain the rules for the result type

#### Type assertions

The `is` operator is a boolean expression which tests tag of a tagged union
against a type.

```hare
let x: (i32 | f32) = 13.37;
if (x is i32) {
	io::println("x is an i32");
} else if (x is f32) {
	io::println("x is an f32");
};
```

The `as` operator is a type assertion on a tagged union. It's used when you
*know* that a tagged union has a specific value, and converts it to that
representation. For example:

```hare
let x: (i32 | f32) = 1337i32;
io::println(strconv::i32tos(x as i32));
```

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
This assumption is checked at runtime, and the program will abort if it is
wrong. To circumvent this, use a <a href="#explicit-casts">cast</a>.

#### Using void in a tagged union

The `void` type can be used to indicate the absence of a value:

```hare
let x: (i32 | f32 | void) = void;
if (x is void) {
	io::println("There's nothing here!");
};
```

### Enums

TODO

### User-defined types

You can create a user-defined type, also known as a "type alias", with the
`type` keyword. For example:

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

type my_int = int;

export fn main() void = {
	const x: my_int = 1337;
	io::println(strconv::itos(x));
};
```

#### Type aliases and structs

There are some extra semantics around user-defined struct types which can save
you some typing:

```hare
use io;
use strconv;

type coordinates = struct {
	x: int,
	y: int,
};

export fn main() void = {
	const coords = coordinates { y = 10, x = 20 };
	io::println(strconv::itos(coords.x));
	io::println(strconv::itos(coords.y));
};
```

By specifying the type name in the struct initializer, you need not write the
types of each struct field, and may specify them out of order.

#### Type aliases and tagged unions

The `...` operator can be used to "unwrap" a type alias into its underlying
type. Consider the following example:

```hare
type my_int = int;
let x: ...my_int = 10;
```

The type of `x` is `int`, not `my_int`. Kind of silly here, but check out these
tagged unions:

```hare
type signed = (i8 | i16 | i32 | i64);
type unsigned = (u8 | u16 | u32 | u64);
type integer = (...signed | ...unsigned);
```

The `interger` type can store any of `i8`, `i16`, `u8`, `u64`, and so on.  But,
if you didn't unwrap these aliases, it would be a tagged union *of* tagged
unions, storing either a signed tagged union or an unsigned tagged union.

You don't always want to do this, though. Here's another example:

```hare
type error_a = void;
type error_b = void;
type error_c = str;
type error_d = (error_a | error_b | error_c);
```

If you had unwrapped these, it would reduce to `(void | str)`, and you wouldn't
be able to distinguish between `error_a` and `error_b`.

## More expressions

### switch

A switch expression can be thought of as a specialized "if" expression. Given a
value, it tests it against a number of possibilities and takes the appropriate
branch.

```hare
io::println(switch (x) {
	1 => "one",
	2 => "two",
	3 => "many",
	* => "lots",
});
```

<p class="alert"><strong>Notice</strong><br />
Switch expressions are required to be <em>exhaustive</em>, meaning that all
possible cases are handled. The <code>*</code> case is used to match any case
which is not explicitly handled.
</p>

If all cases have the same type, the type of the switch expression is that type.
Otherwise, the type is void. However, any branches which *terminate* are not
considered in this respect.

```hare
io::println(switch (x) {
	1 => "one",
	2 => "two",
	3 => "many",
	* => {
		log::errorln("too many!");
		return;
	},
});
```

### defer

TODO

### assert

The `assert` keyword can be used to validate your assumptions at runtime.

```hare
fn sqrt(x: f32) f32 = {
	assert(x > 0, "Cannot take square root of negative number");
	// ...
};
```

If the condition fails, the program is aborted and the message is printed. If
you omit this message, a more generic error message is shown.

You can also do *static* assertions to validate your assumptions at
compile-time. This will cause the build to fail on a 32-bit system:

```hare
static assert(size(*void) == 8, "This module only supports 64-bit systems");
```

You can also use the `abort()` keyword to simply abort without any fanfare. This
is most often useful to cause one of your branches to *terminate* &mdash; see
[matching](#matching).

## More functions

### Test functions

You may write a "test" function by decorating it with the `@test` attribute,
like so:

```hare
fn add_two(x: int) int = x + 2;

@test fn add_two_test() void = {
	assert(add_two(5) == 7, "5 + 2");
	assert(add_two(10) == 12, "10 + 2");
	assert(add_two(-5) == -3, "-5 + 2");
};
```

The function signature must match this, i.e. it shall take no parameters and
return `void`. To run this test, use the following command:

```
$ hare test add_two.ha
add_two_test....		OK
```

You could choose to run only this test with the following:

```
$ hare test -n add_two_test add_two.ha
add_two_test....		OK
```

See the [hare(1)](#TODO) man page for more details.

### Initialization functions

You may declare initialization (or "init") functions, which are executed before
"main" on your program startup, with the `@init` attribute:

```hare
let x: int = 0;

@init fn init() void = {
	x = 10;
};

export fn main() void = {
	assert(x == 10);
};
```

Like `@test` functions, init functions must take no parameters and return
`void`. Finalizers are also available via `@fini`, which are run before the
program terminates.

### Function pointers

Function pointers allow you to store a reference to a function in a variable.
The syntax for a function pointer is <code>*fn<em>(parameters...)</em>
<em>type</em></code>. The parameter list is optional. Some examples include
`*fn void` and `*fn(int, int) int`. You may take the address of a function with
the `&` operator, like any other variable.

```hare
fn add(x: int, y: int) int = x + y;
fn sub(x: int, y: int) int = x - y;

fn ten(op: *fn(int, int) int, x: int) int = op(10, x);

export fn main() void = {
	let f: *fn(int, int) int = &add;
	assert(ten(f, 3) == 13);
	f = &sub;
	assert(ten(f, 3) == 7);
};
```

### Static bindings

In the context of a function, you may create *static* bindings. These variables
are initialized once &mdash; and *only* once &mdash; and keep their value in
subsequent calls to the same function.

```hare
fn counter() int = {
	static let x = 0;
	x += 1;
	return x;
};

export fn main() void = {
	assert(counter() == 1);
	assert(counter() == 2);
	assert(counter() == 3);
};
```

## Type casting

TODO: This section is written for people already familiar with casts in other
languages, it's a bit too thick for noobs

### Implicit casts

It is possible to use a value of one type in a context where another type is
called for, in a limited set of circumstances.

For **integer** types (`int`, `uint`, `i8-i64`, `u8-u64`, `size`, and
`uintptr`), a value can be implicitly cast only if it would not cause a loss of
precision. For example, an `i8` can be assigned to an `i32`, but not the
inverse. Unsigned and signed integer types are not mutually assignable.

```hare
let x: i32 = 10i8; // Acceptable
let y: i32 = 10u8; // Not acceptable
let z: i8 = 12345; // Not acceptable
```

A **tagged union** may be assigned from value of any of its member types.

```hare
let x: (int | *str | void) = 1234; // Acceptable
```

**Strings** may be implicitly cast to `*char`, for easier use with C functions.
See [C compatibility](#c-compatibility) for details.

### Explicit casts

Explicit casts are to be used with caution, as they are one mechanism by which
the programmer can override the best judgement of the compiler. The syntax for
an explicit cast is similar to a variable declaration:
<code><em>expression</em>: <em>type</em></code>, e.g. `1234: i8`.

```hare
let x: int = 1234;
let y = x: f64;
```

When casting **numeric** types, a loss in precision will result in the value
being truncated towards the least significant bits. For example, casting
`0x1234` to `u8` will produce `0x34`.

**Struct** types cannot be cast to any other struct type. **Union** types may be
cast to any of their member types.

Any **pointer** type may be cast to any other pointer type, or to and from
`uintptr`. This may also be used to cast owned pointers to borrowed pointers and
vice versa; use this feature with great caution. The semantics of casting
between the referent types of each pointer type (the referent type being `int`
in the example of `*int`) is not taken into account; normally impossible
casts are permitted through pointer indirection.

```hare
let x: int = 1234;
let y = &x: *io::file; // Acceptable (but ill-advised)
```

**Tagged unions** may be cast to any of their member types. This will not cause
a runtime type assertion to be emitted.

### Type promotion

*Type promotion* is used in arithmetic expressions to "promote" numeric types to
avoid precision loss. If two numeric types which can be implicitly cast to one
another appear as the left and right values to a binary operator (such as `+`,
addition), the lower precision value is implicitly cast (or "promoted") to the
higher precision type.

```hare
let x: i8 = 42;
let y: i16 = 1337;
let z = x + y; // z's type is i16
```

## Modules

### Importing modules

You may have noticed that we have a few `use` statements at the top of each of
our example files. These are used to import modules from the standard library,
or from your program's third-party dependencies. The convention is to sort use
statements alphabetically at the top of your program.

[Documentation is available](/documentation) for the standard library.

### Using third-party dependencies

### Module path resolution

#### Vendoring dependencies

### Build tags

Some build tags are built-in &mdash; they vary depending on your platform and
are printed when you run `hare version`.

## C compatibility

Hare types are a strict superset of C types, and Hare is compatible with the C99
ABI. It is possible to represent any Hare type as a C type.

Primitive types, pointers, structs, and unions are directly compatible with
their C counterparts. Slices, strings, and tagged unions require some extra work
for ABI compatibility.

Slices are represented as follows:

```hare
type my_slice = []int;
```

```c
struct my_slice {
	int *data;
	size_t length, capacity;
};
```

### Strings

Strings are represented as follows:

```c
struct hare_string {
	const char *data;
	size_t length, capacity;
};
```

In Hare programs, `str` can be cast to `*const char`, producing a pointer
compatible with C's `const char *` type.

TODO: Tagged unions

### Namespaces

Hare namespaces are not compatible with C. However, the `@symbol` attribute is
provided, which allows you to override the symbol used for a function or global
in its external linkage. For example:

```hare
export @symbol("foobar") fn my_function() void = {
	// ...
};
```

This will cause the symbol to be named "foobar" in the global namespace. Hare
linkage will still refer to this as `my_namespace::my_function`, but external
code can refer to this as "foobar".

### Variadic functions

Hare programs cannot implement C-style variadic functions. However, Hare
programs can call these functions if they're implemented in C. Forward declare
them like so:

```hare
fn printf(fmt: *char, ...) int;
```

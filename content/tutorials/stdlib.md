title: An introduction to the Hare standard library
type: tutorials
summary: |
  This tutorial introduces you to the Hare standard library. It assumes
  familiarity with most of the fundamental language concepts, which you can
  learn from the [language introduction tutorial]. You are also encouraged to
  make liberal use of the standard library's reference documentation, which is
  available in your terminal via the "haredoc" tool, or available online at
  [docs.harelang.org](https://docs.harelang.org).

  We will not cover the entire standard library in this tutorial, but we will
  introduce you to the most important parts of the standard library, and give
  you an idea of its general design and use.

  <div class="alert">
    <strong>Note:</strong> As you can tell, much of this tutorial remains to be
    written! However, comprehensive reference documentation is available for the
    standard library. You can browse it in your terminal via the "haredoc"
    command, or online at
    <a href="https://docs.harelang.org">docs.harelang.org</a>.
    If you have any questions, do not hestitate to

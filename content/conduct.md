# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of traits
including but not limited to age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Acting with patience, humility, and understanding when helping others, in
  particular less technically experienced members of the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as their personal address,
  without their explicit permission
* Belittling the views of others using coercion or personal attacks
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The conduct enforcement team is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders, including maintainers outside of the conduct enforcement
team, have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned
to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions
when appropriate. Should a maintainer make a discretionary choice with respect
to moderation in the absence of feedback from the conduct enforcement team, the
individuals involved may petition the conduct enforcement team for an
alternative resolution.

Community members are welcome and encouraged to participate in discussions
regarding the code of conduct and its enforcement, and to suggest clarifications
or modifications to the code of conduct, particularly with respect to addressing
ways in which it is lacking sufficient policy and language to make them feel
included and welcome in the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

Egregious violations of our cultural norms, such as displays of intolerance,
harassment, or other egregiously inappropriate behavior outside of our community
spaces may result in enforcement action within the Hare community, in the
interest of providing a safe space for participants who may be threatened by
individuals who engage in inappropriate conduct beyond our borders.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the [Hare
conduct mailing list][mailing list]. The leadership responsible for conduct
enforcement may also be reached individually if the complainant so desires:

[mailing list]: mailto:~sircmpwn/hare-conduct@lists.sr.ht

* Drew DeVault <sir@cmpwn.com>
* Ember Sawady <ecs@d2evs.net>
* Vlad-Stefan Harbuz <vlad@vladh.net>

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Reports are kept in confidence and will not be made
publicly available or shared outside of the conduct enforcement team, unless the
reporter explicitly permits this upon request.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The conduct enforcement team will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code
of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A formal warning with the understanding that any continuation
or escalation of problematic behaviors will lead to further action from the
enforcement team. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is permitted for a
specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community
spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may
lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

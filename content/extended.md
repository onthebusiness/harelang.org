title: Hare extended support libraries
---

A number of additional libraries are available for Hare outside of the standard
library via the Hare extended libraries collection. These are officially
maintained by Hare upstream, but have a wider mandate than the standard library.
This includes extended support for noteworthy operating systems, third-party
applications and standards, and other libraries which are important but do not
fit within the standard library mandate.

These modules have less stringent requirements for portability, stability, and
completeness compared to the standard library.

title: All rabbits welcome
author: the Hare maintainers

We are the maintainers of the Hare programming language, and we support the
right of all people to self-expression, and are building a community in which
all forms of self-expression and identity are welcome, with the exception of
expressions of hate and intolerance.

The Hare community values its professional tone, in which all members are
treated with respect and tolerance as we work towards our shared goals. We
celebrate each other and the role we each play in making this community
welcoming and successful, and the value each of our personal identities brings
to the project and each other. We also provide a safe space in which each
individual's challenges in participating in our community can be heard, and
addressed, to ensure that participants of all backgrounds and experiences are
welcome here.

In particular we affirm the rights, legitimacy, and humanity of disparaged
classes within the free software ecosystem, including but not limited to women,
people of color, transgender individuals, people of all sexual identities and
orientations, and all others besides. You are welcome in our community, as
equals, to learn, to participate, and to lead.

For details on our standards of conduct, and the means of enforcing those
standards, consult the [Code of Conduct](/conduct). If you have any questions,
please reach out to the [conduct mailing list][mailing list].

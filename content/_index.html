  <strong>Notice:</strong>
  This project is under active development. Please do not share this website
  with the others until we believe it's ready for broader distribution. Feel
  free to try out the language and provide feedback as you see fit, but keep it
  to yourself and your colleagues.

<p>
Hare is a statically typed programming language which compiles to machine code.
It has no runtime, manual memory management, and it uses the C ABI. Hare is
designed for systems programming, and is well-suited to writing operating
systems, system tools, compilers, and other low-level, high-performance tasks.

<pre>
<span class="preprocessor">use io;</span>

<span class="keyword">export fn</span> main <span class="type">int</span> =
{
    <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">let</span> x: <span class="type">int</span> = 0; x &lt; 10; x += 1) {
        io::println(<span class="string">"Hello, world!"</span>);
    };
    0;
};
</pre>

<p>
Hare runs on most Unix-like systems, and targets x86_64 and arm64
architectures. If you need additional architectures, they can be added to our
backend in â‰¤2,000 lines of code.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Hare is considered suitable for
production use today.</span> (It will be before the public release)

<h2>Design principles</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Trust the programmer.</li>
  <li>But, provide tools the programmer may use when they don't trust themselves.</li>
  <li>Prefer explicit behavior over implicit behavior.</li>
  <li>Defined behavior is better than undefined behavior.</li>
  <li>In order for a program to be correct, it must be simple.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
Read the <a href="/installation">Installation</a> steps to get Hare for your
system, then read the <a href="/tutorial">Tutorial</a>.

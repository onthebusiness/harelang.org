  <strong>Notice:</strong>
  This project is under active development. Please do not share this website
  with the others until we believe it's ready for broader distribution. Feel
  free to try out the language and provide feedback as you see fit, but keep it
  to yourself and your colleagues.

<p>
Hare is a statically typed programming language which compiles to machine code.
It has assisted memory management, no runtime, and uses the System-V ABI. Hare
is designed for systems programming, and is well-suited to writing operating
systems, system tools, compilers, and other low-level, high-performance tasks.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Hare is considered suitable for
production use today.</span> (It will be before the public release)

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
Read the <a href="/installation">installation steps</a> to get Hare for your
system, then read the <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>. To see if Hare is
available for your system, consult the
<a href="/platforms">supported platforms list</a>.

<h2>Design principles</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Trust the programmer.</li>
  <li>But, provide tools the programmer may use when they don't trust themselves.</li>
  <li>Prefer explicit behavior over implicit behavior.</li>
  <li>Defined behavior is better than undefined behavior.</li>
  <li>In order for a program to be correct, it must be simple.</li>
</ol>

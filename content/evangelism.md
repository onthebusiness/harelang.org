title: Hare evangelism
---

The success of Hare is dependent on having a thriving community of people
working on Hare, using Hare to build cool things, helping each other, and
developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem of tools, libraries, and
other resources. To this end, it's necessary to evangelise Hare a bit, to grow
the ecosystem and attract the interest of people who might like it.

Much like all other goals for Hare, the community is encouraged to contribute by
participating in these efforts. Bringing attention to Hare is a great (and often
under-appreciated) way to contribute to the project.

## Good ideas

These are some good ways to evangelise Hare:

- Publishing content about Hare
  - Write for your personal blog, videos, podcasts, etc
  - Your experiences using Hare and thoughts on the language
  - Write-ups about your Hare projects and contributions
  - Tutorials on Hare libraries or language features[^1]
  - Thoughts on interesting problems you encountered with Hare
- Writing blog posts for harelang.org
  - Outlining discussions from Hare RFCs
  - Design notes about standard library modules
  - Design notes about the compiler or language features
  - etc
- Signal-boosting cool projects written in Hare
- Helping Hare users find interested collaborators
- Participating in (organic!) online discussions about Hare on forums, Mastodon,
  HN, etc
- Participating in industry events (e.g. Advent of Code) with Hare and writing
  about your experience
- Talking about Hare at in-person events and conferences

The [hare-evangelism][0] mailing list has been set up to discuss the broader
promotion of Hare. This is a great place to seek feedback on an idea, propose
topics for blog posts, draw attention to notable projects, or seek editoral
feedback on your writing. This is also where you should go if you, random
internet user, find yourself thinking "wow these Hare users are annoying shills"
so that we can talk about that.

[^1]: Be careful not to abandon tutorials to bitrot &mdash; consider updating
    them as the language develops and they become outdated, or linking to
    official (maintained) resources on the subject where possible.

## Bad ideas

The following kinds of marketing activities are explicitly discouraged:

- Paid advertising of any kind; sponsorships, banner ads, etc
- Unsolicited calls for FOSS projects to write/rewrite their code in Hare
- Putting down other programming languages or projects because Hare is "better"

When discussing Hare outside of Hare community spaces, the Hare [Code of
Conduct][1] is not necessarily in effect. Nevertheless, you are strongly
encouraged to behave as if it was, and to speak with kindness and empathy
&mdash; don't get into flamewars!
